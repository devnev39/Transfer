Client connect

From Client
    get commands

    -   Need    -  
    server to have commands 
    how to add new command 
        1 - create a list of commands and update it with creating respective command method
        2 - create  a command class which will hold and execute the respective command
    
    example commands -> 
        a. ls -> list files
        b. cd -> change directory (only below root)
        c. get -> get the file 
        d. list_con -> get active connection to the server (TEST CMD)
        e. DISCON111 -> disconnect from server

From client side

Take the input 
check if we have the input as command in commands list
if there is then 
    command.procedure.executeClientProcedure()
    -> This method will handle all the send and receive pattern of that command

    At server -> 
    client class will receive the command
    find command in commands list
    if found -> 
        command.procedure.executeServerProcedure()

2 types of response from server ->
    1. Text
    2. File 

    1. For text -> 
        first send if exeption occured by sending a int 
        second send the length of the message (bytes)
        third send the actual message
    
    2. For file -> 
        first send if exception occured
        second send the lenght of the file (bytes)
        third send the actual file bytes

LS -> list files and folder of root directory
cd -> change the root within the b boundry
